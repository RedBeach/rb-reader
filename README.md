# Red Beach Reader Library

Codes that reads bar code. The code is for use with Corona SDK


# How to use
1) Require the lib
2) Call 'show' function to display the reader
3) Call 'read' function to read the bar code


# Current Limitations

1) Only reads UPC 12-digit bar codes for now
2) Bar code cannot be read upside-down


# Improvements needed

1) Add support to QR Code
2) Be able to read the bar code from up-side down
3) Add support to the zero-suppressed UPC bar code (6-8 digits instead of 12)
4) Test if using some kind of filter improves the reading
5) Add support to other bar code formats
6) Add reading on-the-fly support
